title: 'FE + BE Collaborative Project'
phase: 3
layout: daily_post
---

This week you will begin work on a project with both front-end and back-end teammates. This project is due at the end of the Phase, on {{ site.data.phase3.projects.collaborative_project.due_date | date: "%A, %B %e" }}.

In order to successfully complete Phase 3 and qualify for Phase 4:

- This project must be complete and meet the minimum requirements.
- It must be deployed and running without errors in production.
- Each team member must make a substantive contribution to the project. This is best demonstrated through frequent, well-formed commits.
- Each team member must be able to explain how the project works (that is, back-end devs know how the back-end works; front-end devs know how the front-end works).

We haven't yet covered everything you'll need to be able to do this project, so that will be our task this week and next.

## üèóÔ∏è X-Team Project

You'll work on two combined front-end and back-end teams. Each team will build a different project and will use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to track project todos.

### How to accept the assignment and create the repos on GitHub

The back end and front end will work in the same repo. Your team will have one repo.

**One dev** should accept the assignment invitation first and create a new team; name the team something like "Team Yeti" (or whatever your team name is!). Then the other back-end dev(s) should accept the assignment and choose the right team. All back-end folks on the team clone that same repo.

‚ö†Ô∏è You have to accept the invitation and join the team your teammate created in order to have write permissions to the repo.

**Today you should not need to clone, commit, or push any code since your main goal is planning**.

### How to work as one team
{:.section}

Even though you have separate responsibilities on the front-end and back-end, you're working together to ship a single product, on time. You can make product decisions together even though you will implement features separately.

We'll check in on the projects each day. Front and back end teams will continue to meet separately at regular meeting times, and you will also meet as a project team with an instructor on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. You are expected to come to your front-end or back-end meeting prepared to give progress reports. We're also expecting you to ask for help frequently throughout this extended project.

You are encouraged to work with the other front-end or back-end devs on other teams to share ideas, solutions, and resources.

### ü•Ö Your Goals Today ü•Ö

- Read your project's README.
- Read your project's README again, carefully.
- Understand the project requirements thoroughly and discuss with your team what you need to build.
- Outline a detailed plan for how your team will implement the project requirements.
- **WRITE YOUR PLANS DOWN.** You can make your initial plans using any tool you like (e.g. Google Docs, Miro, Trello, Excalidraw). Make sure everyone on your team has access to this documentation.
- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to create code todos for your project.

#### Front-end

You will need to sketch out the **[user flow](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1926-a-shorthand-for-designing-ui-flows)** and [draw up some **wireframes**](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-design-101/) for the application. It can help to ask questions like:

- What does our user see when they first land on our site?
- What will they need to do here?
- How will they accomplish that?
- What will happen next?
- If they click on a button or link, what happens?
- What does the UI look like after the user clicks on something / follows a link / submits a form?

##### By tomorrow front-end should have

- A detailed user flow plan/diagram
- Detailed wireframes
- A good initial plan of the components you think you will need

#### Back-end

You will need to draw ER diagrams to plan out the **models** and start a list of **endpoints** you think you will need. It can help to ask questions like:

- What are the _nouns_ in your project requirements? These are likely models.
- What data will you need to save in your database so you can look it up again later?
- What information will the front-end need so they can accomplish the UI that they are planning?
- What permissions will need to be in place?

##### By tomorrow back-end should have

- ER Diagrams for your models
- A list of endpoints
- A good initial plan for the JSON you think you will need to return

### Git Workflow

Working with other developers in a shared codebase means that the workflow you've been using so far will have to change. **We will cover this together on Tuesday.** If you want to get a head start, here are the slides for reference.
