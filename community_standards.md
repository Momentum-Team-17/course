# Momentum Community Standards

Momentum is above all a community of continuous learners. Each one of us helps to build this community and our learning environment each day. We’ve given careful thought to the things we value in each other and in our community as a whole.

## Expectations

We will take responsibility for guiding and mentoring you; you will take responsibility for getting the most out of this program.

### Ask questions without reservation.

If you are confused or need more information, ask a question. It's ok to ask questions even when you don't know what to ask. We expect that you will need help.

### Do all the work we ask you to do.

We don’t expect you’ll get through to the end of every project. The projects are hard, and half of programming is learning from our mistakes.

### Do your best to figure things out.

We don't expect you know how to do anything, but we do expect you to figure things out. That means looking things up 

### Keep trying even when it gets really hard.

You'll have to get used to doing things that you barely understand, working through frustration, and asking for the help that you need. Don't give up; you CAN do this!

### Treat everyone with respect.

You’re going to meet people not like you here. You’re going to wonder why someone’s not getting it sometimes, and you’re going to wonder why everyone but you is getting it. Learning to program is fun but frustrating. Don’t take those frustrations out on others.

### Type out all your code. No copy-and-paste!

When you copy and paste code, even code you fully understand, you miss out on a learning opportunity. Use examples and learn from them, but even if you’re using a snippet verbatim, **type it out**.

## Our Learning Environment and Values

Together we create an environment that is supportive of the hard work of learning to code.

We collaborate with each other, and we give each other space for focused time when we need it.

At Momentum, it is safe to ask questions, to make mistakes, and to try new things without a guarantee that everything will go perfectly well.

We are curious and open minded, receptive to each other’s thoughts and ideas, and generous with our help.

Patience, kindness, and compassion towards ourselves and towards others will make meeting our shared and individual goals more possible.

We celebrate each other’s successes and empathize with each other’s struggles.

## Social Rules

We’ve borrowed the social rules defined by [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in New York, a community for experienced programmers to learn together. They are not focused on those new to coding, but they are focused on building a supportive learning environment, and we really like their way of thinking.

Below are [the social rules defined by the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules). The text is written by the Recurse Center, because we couldn’t have said it better, but we’ve adopted the letter and spirit as our own. These rules go into practical detail about respectful collaboration and discourse in a tech context.

### No feigning surprise

The first rule means you shouldn’t act surprised when people say they don’t know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can’t believe you don’t know what the stack is!") and non-technical things (“You don’t know who RMS is?!”).

### No well-actually’s

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor correction. This can be very disruptive when the correction has no bearing on the crux of the conversation

### No back-seat driving

If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn’t intermittently lob advice across the room. This can lead to the "too many cooks" problem, but more important, it can be rude and disruptive to half-participate in a conversation. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t help, offer advice, or join conversations. On the contrary, we encourage all those things. Rather, it just means that when you want to help out or work with others, you should fully engage and not just butt in sporadically.

### No subtle -isms

Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias. Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake.

For example, saying "It’s so easy my grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it’s not a big deal to mess up; you just apologize and move on.

## Using code you didn’t write

Inevitably you will find code online that makes sense to include in what you’re writing. Every developer does it. You will find code examples on Stack Overflow, in CSS-Tricks articles, in documentation and blog posts. The nature of this work means that concepts are often best explained with examples.

It is fine to use a line or two of code you found somewhere else *if you understand what it does*. **Never** copy and paste code. If you are using code you found elsewhere, type it out by hand to make sure you understand it and remember it.

If you want to use a longer snippet of code, it’s probably not a good idea to do that. If you feel you have good reasons, please attribute the borrowed code in a comment, along with a URL, if possible.

Above all, don’t pass off work by someone else as your own. Not only does this violate our Code of Conduct, but it also hinders your learning and will not serve you in becoming a professional developer.

## Using Slack

We use Slack for communication. Please read and follow the [Momentum Community Slack guidelines here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1updvgMnO2xAAfP46oW__d3-nhv4hPodW7WvxKWX87JA/edit?usp=sharing
).

Slack lets us organize conversations in different channels. You've already been added to your team channel but you'll also want to join the conversations with Momentum alums in #general and #code-help. There are other channels you can explore as well; check them out by clicking on "Channels" in the Slack sidebar.

When asking instructors for code help, _please post your question in a public channel_. Openly asking questions will benefit everyone on your team, so we strongly prefer discussing them publicly. Use direct messages when you need to discuss personal information.
