### Custom hooks for local storage

- [Persisting React State in localstorage](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/persisting-react-state-in-localstorage/) _This blog post explains why you'd use a custom hook for this purpose as well as how you'd write it from scratch._
- [useLocalStorageState](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) _This npm package gives you a custom hook to do what the above article walks you through doing._

## Forms

_See also [JS: Forms][js-forms] and [HTML: Forms][html-forms]_

- [React beta docs API reference: working with `<input>`](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react-dom/components/input)
- [React Mental Model: Working with Input](https://learnreact.design/posts/react-mental-model-html-input)

- [React Official Docs: Uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)
- [Controlled vs uncontrolled form inputs in React](https://goshakkk.name/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react/) _This is a good summary of the two options for forms in React, but be aware that the code examples use the older class syntax instead of function components with hooks._
- [Data Binding in React (Using different form fields and keeping values in sync with state)](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/data-binding/)

## File Upload

- [MDN: File input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)
- [MDN: Accessing selected files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications#accessing_selected_files)
- [using the FormData object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects) You do not need to use this, but many online tutorials about file upload will show examples using this, and it is helpful to know about.

## Authentication

- [Token Authentication Endpoint guide for djoser library](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/token_endpoints.html) -> This is the library being used by the backend

## Local Storage and State

- [use-local-storage-state](https://github.com/astoilkov/use-local-storage-state) -> You would `npm install use-local-storage-state` to use it in your code
    - Check out [this custom hook code example](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/), which shows how you could implement this yourself (you could even borrow this code and use it in your project instead of the above library if you wanted to!).
- [Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) Using local storage without syncing it with state may cause weird bugs, but you should know about the underlying local storage API that is implemented in browsers.

## Deployment

## File Structure

This is _very_ subjective, but there are strategies and organizational patterns that you can follow. You should follow the practices and conventions established by the team that you work with.

For starters, here are two good takes on how to organize your files.

### General

- [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

### Filtering existing data in your component

You could also perform a search without making an AJAX request, by filtering data that you already have in React. Here are a couple of examples of how you could do that.

- [Create a search bar from scratch](https://blog.logrocket.com/create-search-bar-react-from-scratch/)
- [How to Build a Search Bar in React](https://www.emgoto.com/react-search-bar/)
